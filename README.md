# mir_ref

Representation Evaluation Framework for Music Information Retrieval tasks

`mir_ref` is an open-source library for evaluating audio representations (embeddings or others) on a variety of music-related downstream tasks and datasets. It provides ready-to-use tasks, datasets, deformations, embedding models, and downstream models for config-
based, no-code experiment orchestration. Components are modular, so it's easy to add custom embedding models, datasets, metrics etc. Audio-specific results analysis and visualization tools are also provided.

## Installation

Clone the repository. Create and activate a python>3.9 environment and install `mir_ref`.

```
cd mir_ref
pip install -e .
```
